# GitHub Copilot Custom Instructions - Gardening Catalogue

## Project Overview
- This is a React Native mobile application built with Expo Router
- TypeScript is used throughout the project
- Supabase is used for backend authentication and database
- The app manages gardening seeds and suppliers

## Technical Stack
- **Framework**: React Native with Expo SDK 53.0.9
- **Navigation**: Expo Router with file-based routing
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Backend**: Supabase (authentication, database, storage)
- **Styling**: React Native StyleSheet with custom components
- **State Management**: React Context (AuthProvider) + useState/useEffect
- **UI Components**: Custom components with Lucide React Native icons

## Architecture Patterns
- Use Expo Router for navigation with tab-based structure in `app/(tabs)/`
- Follow the existing authentication pattern using `lib/auth.tsx` with AuthProvider
- Use the established component structure in `components/` directory
- Maintain consistency with database types defined in `types/database.ts`


### File Structure
- `app/` - Expo Router pages with file-based routing
- `app/(tabs)/` - Tab-based navigation screens
- `app/auth/` - Authentication related screens
- `components/` - Reusable UI components
- `lib/` - Utility functions and service configurations
- `types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `assets/` - Static assets (fonts, images)

### Component Patterns
- Use functional components with React hooks
- Create reusable components in the `components/` directory
- Use functional components with React hooks
- Follow the existing pattern for form components (see AddSupplierForm)
- Use proper TypeScript props interfaces
- Create index.tsx files for component directories
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for all props
- Use React.memo for performance optimization when needed

### Authentication
- Use the established AuthProvider pattern from `lib/auth.tsx`
- Check authentication state with `useAuth()` hook
- Implement protected routes using session checks
- Store sensitive data using Expo SecureStore

## Database & API
- Use Supabase client from `lib/supabase.ts`
- Follow the established patterns for Supplier and Seed data models
- Implement proper authentication checks before database operations
- Use the existing database schema types

### Database Operations
- Use Supabase client from `lib/supabase.ts`
- Follow the database types defined in `types/database.ts`
- Implement proper error handling for all async operations
- Use TypeScript interfaces for Supplier and Seed models

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Follow the existing naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components)
- Use Poppins font family as established in the project
- Implement proper error handling for async operations

## File Organization
- Place new screens in appropriate `app/` subdirectories
- Create reusable components in `components/`
- Add utilities in `utils/` directory
- Follow the existing folder structure

### TypeScript
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Define interfaces for all data structures
- Use proper typing for Supabase operations
- Implement type-safe database operations

### React Native Styling
- Use StyleSheet.create() for component styles
- Follow the existing color scheme and design patterns
- Use Poppins font family (loaded in _layout.tsx)
- Implement responsive design considerations
- Use Expo LinearGradient and other Expo modules as established

### Component Structure
```tsx
interface ComponentProps {
  // Define all props with proper types
}

export default function Component({ prop1, prop2 }: ComponentProps) {
  // State and effects first
  // Event handlers
  // Render logic
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      {/* JSX content */}
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  // Styles at the bottom
});
```

### Form Handling
- Use controlled components with useState
- Implement proper validation
- Show loading states during submission
- Handle errors gracefully with user feedback
- Follow the pattern established in AddSupplierForm

### Image Handling
- Use ImageHandler component for image operations
- Support both camera capture and gallery selection
- Implement proper image upload to Supabase storage
- Handle multiple images when required

## Naming Conventions
- **Files**: kebab-case for files (`add-supplier.tsx`)
- **Components**: PascalCase (`AddSupplierForm`)
- **Variables**: camelCase (`supplierName`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`API_URL`)
- **Types/Interfaces**: PascalCase (`Supplier`, `DatabaseType`)

## Error Handling
- Always implement try-catch for async operations
- Show user-friendly error messages
- Log errors appropriately for debugging
- Handle network failures gracefully
- Provide fallback UI states

## Performance Considerations
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement proper key props for lists
- Use FlatList/FlashList for large datasets
- Optimize image loading and caching
- Minimize re-renders with proper dependency arrays

## Supabase Patterns
- Use the Database type from `types/database.ts`
- Implement RLS (Row Level Security) awareness
- Handle authentication state changes
- Use proper error handling for Supabase operations
- Follow the established patterns for CRUD operations

## UI/UX Guidelines
- Follow Material Design principles
- Use consistent spacing and typography
- Implement proper loading states
- Provide clear user feedback
- Use haptic feedback appropriately
- Maintain accessibility standards

## Dependencies Management
- Prefer Expo-compatible packages
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Use established libraries in the project
- Check compatibility with the current Expo SDK version (53.0.9)
- Document any new dependencies added

## Testing Considerations
- Write testable code with proper separation of concerns
- Mock Supabase operations in tests
- Test authentication flows
- Validate form submissions
- Test image upload functionality

## When Adding New Features
1. Follow the existing file structure
2. Create reusable components when possible
3. Implement proper TypeScript types
4. Add appropriate error handling
5. Follow the established styling patterns
6. Test on both iOS and Android if possible
7. Consider offline scenarios
8. Update documentation as needed

## Common Patterns to Follow
- Authentication checks before sensitive operations
- Proper loading states for async operations
- Consistent error message formatting
- Image optimization and handling
- Form validation and submission
- Navigation patterns with Expo Router
- State management with React Context
