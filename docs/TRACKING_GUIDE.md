## Tracking Methods by Use Case

| Use Case | Method | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Bug found while coding | GitHub Issue | Create bug report immediately |
| Quick feature idea | TODO.ts or Dev Notes | Add comment in relevant file |
| User feedback | GitHub Issue | Use feature request template |
| Version planning | ROADMAP.md | Update roadmap with timeline |

## GitHub Labels for Organization

Create these labels in your GitHub repository:
- `enhancement` - New features
- `bug` - Bug reports
- `quick-win` - Easy to implement
- `calendar` - Calendar-related features
- `analytics` - Data and reporting
- `ui-ux` - User interface improvements
- `technical-debt` - Code improvements
- `research` - Needs investigation

## VS Code Extensions for Todo Tracking

Install these extensions:
- **TODO Highlight** - Highlights TODO comments in code
- **Todo Tree** - Shows all TODOs in explorer
- **GitHub Issues** - Manage issues from VS Code

## Example Workflow

1. **Coding Session**: Notice improvement → Add TODO comment in code
2. **End of Day**: Review TODO comments → Create GitHub issues
3. **Weekly Planning**: Review issues → Update roadmap priorities
4. **Version Release**: Update roadmap → Archive completed features

This system scales from quick thoughts to full project planning!
